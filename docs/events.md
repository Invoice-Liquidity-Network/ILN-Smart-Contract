# ILN Smart Contract Event Schema

## Overview

This document is the result of a full event-emission completeness audit
(Issue #538): every state-changing (storage-mutating) function across all
five contracts was mapped and checked for event coverage. Gaps found during
the audit have been fixed in the same change that produced this document —
see "Audit summary" below for what was added and why.

Events are consumed by indexers, blockchain explorers, and off-chain backend
integrations as the audit trail for on-chain state transitions. Indexers
should reconstruct state from these events rather than scraping ledger
entries directly.

## Audit summary

| Contract | Function | Before | Fix |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `initialize` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_distribution_contract` | No event | Added `DistributionContractUpdated` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_price_oracle` | No event | Added `PriceOracleUpdated` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_max_oracle_age` | No event | Reused `ParameterUpdated` |
| `insurance_pool` | `initialize` | No event | Added inline `init` event (coverage cap) |
| `reputation_bonus` | `init` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `set_config` (raw setter, distinct from `update_config`) | No event | Added `ConfigSet` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `submit_invoice` | No event | Added `InvoiceSubmitted` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `mark_paid` | No event | Added `InvoiceStatusChanged` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `handle_default` | No event | Added `InvoiceStatusChanged` |
| `iln_distribution` | `initialize` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `iln_distribution` | `accrue_lp` | No event | Added `LpVolumeAccrued` |
| `iln_distribution` | `accrue_settlement` | No event | Added `SettlementAccrued` |
| `iln_distribution` | `claim_tokens` | No event | Added `TokensClaimed` |
| `iln_governance` | `initialize` | No event | Added `GovernanceInitialized` |
| `iln_governance` | `set_min_quorum_bps` | No event | Added `GovernanceParameterUpdated` |
| `iln_governance` | `set_min_proposal_balance` | No event | Added `GovernanceParameterUpdated` |
| `iln_governance` | `set_execution_delay` | No event | Added `GovernanceParameterUpdated` |
| `iln_governance` | `disable_veto_power` | No event | Added `VetoPowerDisabled` |

All other state-changing functions across all five contracts already emitted
events prior to this audit (verified function-by-function; see per-contract
sections below for the full inventory, including functions that were
correctly found to need no event because they are pure read-only views).

Two events referenced by a stale prior version of this document —
`ContractPaused`/`ContractUnpaused` "missing struct" and `TokenAdded`/
`TokenRemoved`/`InvoiceExpired`/`InvoiceDisputed`/`ReputationUpdated`/
`LPPositionTransferred` "not emitted" — were already fully implemented in
the code by the time of this audit; the document had simply not been kept in
sync with the contract. This rewrite corrects that drift for all five
contracts and should be kept current going forward.

### Invoice NFT lifecycle

Defined in `nft.rs`, emitted alongside the corresponding invoice lifecycle
events. These events let indexers track invoice-NFT ownership changes (e.g.
freelancer → LP on funding) and power NFT marketplace features.

> **Deprecation note:** the current implementation emits these events with the
deprecated `env.events().publish()` method. The project tracks the migration
to the `#[contractevent]` macro in [Issue #26](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/issues/26).
Topic names and payload fields below are the target schemas and will not change
with the migration.

#### InvoiceNftMinted

Emitted when an invoice NFT is created for a new invoice (`submit_invoice`).

Topics: `["invoice_nft_minted", invoice_id, owner]`

| `owner` | `Address` | Initial owner (the freelancer) |
| `amount` | `i128` | Total invoice amount |
| `due_date` | `u32` | Invoice due date |
| `timestamp` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp of minting |

Example payload:

```json
{
  "invoice_id": 42,
  "owner": "GAAAAAAAACGC6W2H7Z2G4QZ5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5Z5",
  "amount": 5000000000,
  "due_date": 1767225600,
  "timestamp": 1764633600
}
```

#### InvoiceNftTransferred

Emitted when an invoice NFT changes owner, e.g. freelancer → LP when the
invoice is funded (`fund_invoice`).

Topics: `["invoice_nft_transferred", invoice_id, from, to]`

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Invoice the NFT represents |

}
```

#### InvoiceNftBurned

fully paid (`mark_paid`).

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Invoice the NFT represented |
| `owner` | `Address` | Owner at burn time (the LP holding the NFT) |

| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `admin` | `Address` | The initial pool admin |
| `coverage` | `i128` | Flat per-claim coverage cap |

### Enrolled

Topics: `["enrolled", lp]`

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lp` | `Address` | LP enrolled in the pool |

**Example**: An LP calls `enroll()` or makes their first premium deposit, triggering enrollment.

### PremiumDeposited

Emitted when an LP deposits a premium payment. The amount is the premium paid in stroops.

Topics: `["premium", lp]`

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `lp` | `Address` | LP paying the premium |
| `amount` | `i128` | Premium amount transferred (in stroops) |

**Example**: An LP deposits 100 USDC as premium, which is recorded as 100,000,000 stroops.

### ClaimProcessed

Emitted when a claim is processed for a defaulted invoice. The payout is the compensation amount credited to the LP.

Topics: `["claimed", invoice_id]`

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `invoice_id` | `u64` | Defaulted invoice identifier |
| `payout` | `i128` | Compensation amount paid to LP (in stroops) |

**Example**: An invoice with ID 123 defaults, and the LP receives a payout of 50 USDC (50,000,000 stroops) from the insurance pool.

### CoverageChangeProposed

Topics: `["cov_prop"]`

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

### AdminTransferCancelled

Topics: `["adm_cncl"]`

| Field | Type | Description |

The timelock propose/execute/cancel flow is documented in detail in
[`insurance-pool-design.md`](./insurance-pool-design.md).

## `reputation_bonus`

| Function | Event coverage |
| -------- | --------------- |
| `init` | ✅ `ContractInitialized` (added by this audit) |
| `set_config` | ✅ `ConfigSet` (added by this audit) |
| `update_config` | ✅ `ParameterUpdated` ×3 (one per changed field — pre-existing) |
| `submit_invoice` | ✅ `InvoiceSubmitted` (added by this audit) |
| `mark_paid` | ✅ `InvoiceStatusChanged` (added by this audit) |
| `handle_default` | ✅ `InvoiceStatusChanged` (added by this audit) |
| `get_config` / `get_reputation` | 🔍 read-only views |

`update_config` and `set_config` both write to the same underlying storage
key but are kept as separate entrypoints with separate events:
`update_config` is the fine-grained, per-field audited path (three
`ParameterUpdated` events, one per field, each carrying the old and new
value), while `set_config` is a bulk replace that emits a single `ConfigSet`
snapshot of the whole config. Note: `set_config` currently has no admin
auth check in `lib.rs` — this is a pre-existing access-control gap, outside
the scope of this event-emission audit, and should be tracked separately.

## Indexer Notes

* **Event Ordering Assumptions**: In `invoice_liquidity`, `InvoiceSubmitted`
  always precedes `InvoiceFunded`, which precedes `InvoicePaid` or
  `InvoiceDefaulted`.
* **State Reconstruction**: `InvoiceSubmitted`/`ContractInitialized`/
  `GovernanceInitialized` include a `timestamp` field specifically so
  indexers can reconstruct creation time without querying ledger headers.
* **Timestamps**: All timestamps are `u64` seconds since the Unix epoch.
* **Amounts**: All numeric amounts (`amount`, `fund_amount`, `lp_payout`,
  etc.) are `i128` in the token's native unit (stroops); format using the
  token's configured decimals for display.
* **Cross-contract correlation**: `iln_distribution`'s `LpVolumeAccrued`/
  `SettlementAccrued` events correlate with `invoice_liquidity`'s
  `InvoiceFunded`/`InvoicePaid` events (same ledger, triggered by the same
  underlying call), but carry no shared invoice id — indexers should
  correlate by ledger sequence + participant address if they need to join
  the two streams.
