# Security Policy

ILN spans Soroban smart contracts, a TypeScript SDK, a CLI, an indexer, and a notifications service. ILN is in experimental/testnet phase — do not use current deployments as mainnet-secure infrastructure until the mainnet checklist, audits, and maintainer sign-off are complete.

For the full policy — including component-specific vulnerability classes, detailed severity definitions, response timelines, reporting instructions, safe harbor, and maintainer handling procedures — see [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Responsible Disclosure

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers have had time to investigate and remediate them.

Report privately, in this order of preference:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** — <https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract/security/advisories/new>. This is the channel intended for ILN reports: the draft advisory stays private to you and the maintainers until a fix is published. If the page returns `404` for your signed-in account, private vulnerability reporting has not been enabled on this repository yet — an owner needs to turn it on, as described in [Enabling Private Vulnerability Reporting (Owner Only)](../SECURITY.md#enabling-private-vulnerability-reporting-owner-only).
2. **Email** — there is currently **no reachable ILN security mailbox**. Both addresses that have appeared in this repository in the past are undeliverable: `security@invoice-liquidity-network.local` (`.local` is reserved for multicast DNS and is never resolved publicly) and `security@invoiceliquidity.network` (the domain has no DNS records, so no `MX`). The status of each channel, including the one address in [docs/upgrade-guide.md](upgrade-guide.md) that an owner still has to disown or confirm, is recorded in [Contact Status](../SECURITY.md#contact-status). Do not mail an address listed there as broken — the report is lost silently.

If neither option is available to you, open an issue containing **no detail about the finding** and ask a maintainer for a private channel. Never post reproduction steps, an affected function, or a proof of concept publicly.

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical | Direct loss or theft of user funds, permanent protocol insolvency, or unauthenticated upgrade/admin takeover |
| High | Material fund risk, broad data integrity failure, secret exposure, or reliable service compromise |
| Medium | Limited financial or operational impact, denial of service with recovery path, or scoped data exposure |
| Low | Defense-in-depth issue, documentation security gap, low-impact information exposure |
| Informational | No immediate exploit path but useful for hardening |

## Response Commitments

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Initial severity assessment | Within 5 business days |
| Critical fix | Begin mitigation immediately; target patch within 7 days |
| High fix | Target patch within 14 days |
| Medium fix | Target patch within 30 days |

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for full details including safe harbor, maintainer handling procedures, and the security checklist for releases.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Experimental/testnet | Best-effort security fixes |
| Mainnet | Not yet launched |

## Bug Bounty Program (Post-Mainnet)

We operate a continuous bug bounty program to reward researchers for finding vulnerabilities in ILN Smart Contracts.

### Scope
- In-scope: All production Soroban contracts (`contracts/*`) deployed to mainnet.
- Out-of-scope: CLI utilities, off-chain indexers, demo scripts.

### Reward Tiers (USDC)
- **Critical:** Up to $50,000
- **High:** Up to $15,000
- **Medium:** Up to $5,000
- **Low:** Up to $1,000

Rewards are funded directly from the ILN DAO Treasury multi-sig.

### Safe Harbor
Good faith security research that follows this disclosure policy will be considered authorized. We will not pursue civil or criminal action against researchers who comply with these guidelines.

### Contact Rotation and Backup Coverage
To eliminate single points of failure in incident response:
1. The `security@` alias forwards to the active on-call engineer (rotating weekly).
2. If the on-call engineer does not acknowledge the report within 24 hours (SLA breach), the alias automatically escalates to the full Core Maintainers group.
3. Backup contacts: In the event of a total alias failure, direct messages to core team leads on the official Discord are authorized for initial triage (please do not disclose details publicly).

The `security@` alias described above has not yet been published with a domain in [Contact Status](../SECURITY.md#contact-status), so a researcher cannot confirm that it delivers today. An owner should add the fully-qualified address to that table once mail delivery to it has been tested end to end; until then the private GitHub Security Advisory remains the only channel this policy can verify.
